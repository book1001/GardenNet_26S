                <h3>Description</h3>
                <h4>
                  In this culminating semester, students will independently develop systems and methodologies for solving real-world, pragmatic design problems. Students start by identifying an area of research and discussing its relationship to graphic design and contemporary discourse. The idea of 'designer as author' will be emphasized through a self-motivated design project that will strengthen individual processes, problem-solving capabilities, and design voice. In addition to a thesis project, students will document their design process in a thesis book and present a public exhibition. Upon graduation, students are expected to have developed a refined, intelligent, professional-grade body of work. This course fulfills the following BU Hub areas: Creativity/Innovation, Teamwork/Collaboration.
                  <br><br>
                  This course will help you to work through a process to define, clarify, and articulate what you hold important as a designer. Your thesis process leads to the development of a methodology that will extend beyond your education at BU. Consider your thesis as a timestamp to mark your unique voice and critical perspective at this moment. Treat this as an opportunity to test your ideas and even practice the work you hope to do in your future design practice. In other words, your thesis is not the end of it all. If anything, it’s the beginning of (hopefully) a life-long inquiry, an approach or a lens for which you examine the world around you.
                  <br><br>
                  Our goal is to set the conditions that foster and catalyze your independent research and work. Your work in this course will raise questions of form, content, and audience to challenge and define your perspective on graphic design.

                <h3>Disability Statement</h3>
                <h4>
                  Students who have self-identified, provided documentation of their disability, and requested reasonable accommodations may be entitled to receive approved modifications in the classroom, appropriate academic adjustments, or auxiliary aids that enable them to participate in and benefit from all educational programs and activities. Please see http://www.bu.edu/disability for more details.  
                </h4><br><br>

                <h3>Attendance & Absences</h3>
                <h4>
                  Please make every effort to arrive punctually. You must attend all the classes. According to the SVA Attendance Policy, unless specific permission for absence is arranged with the instructor of this course, students must attend class to receive credit for the course. Unexcused absences exceeding 1/4 of the total class hours in a given semester are considered excessive in all SVA courses. Tardiness and any unexcused absences will reduce your course grade. Three unexcused absences will reduce your semester grade by one step (e.g. A- to B+). Seven unexcused absences will earn you a failing grade for the course.

                <h3>Wellness and Health</h3>
                <h4>
                  Your health and well-being are important for your journey as a professional graphic designer. It is important to work hard and balance that with rest, self-care, and attention to your mental and physical health. I will challenge you in this class through assignments, activities, and discussions. However, the work in this class should not be at the expense of your well-being. If for any reason you are struggling to find balance in your work life and health/wellbeing, please reach out. I am happy to discuss ways in which this class can support you in your learning and growth. You can find more resources provided by BU CFA Mental Health & Wellness Resources.

You are required to use at least two different media (for example, a book and a website, or a workshop and a typeface). Medium 1 and Medium 2 must be completed by March 24 and included in your Thesis Book. During the remaining time leading up to the Thesis Show, you can work on additional pieces for the exhibition, such as extra posters.
